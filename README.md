## My first public website

I have never expected that I will be publishing my own website. I know it's very basic but as you will see in the footeer I'm learning, there's still long way ahead of me to become a pro. First time since school when I used any HTML or CSS so I'm quite happy with the results, while still aware that there's a lot to improve.
